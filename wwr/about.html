                <p>The core goal of whitewater rafting is to navigate the river safely and successfully, using teamwork
                    and skill to
                    conquer the challenging rapids. Beyond navigation, the goal is to provide an exhilarating,
                    adrenaline-filled
                    recreational experience while connecting participants with the natural beauty of the river
                    environment.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of whitewater rafting began with Native American river travel and the 19th-century
                explorations of
                pioneers like John Wesley Powell, who mapped the Grand Canyon using sturdy wooden boats. The sport's
                modern foundation
                was laid in the 1940s and 1950s when World War II surplus inflatable rubber rafts became
                available for
                recreational use. Clyde Smith ran one of the first commercial trips in 1940. The activity rapidly
                grew in the
                1960s and 1970s as technology advanced to create durable, maneuverable, self-bailing rafts,
                transforming necessary
                river navigation into a widely popular commercial adventure sport governed by safety standards like
                the
                International Scale of River Difficulty.</p>
