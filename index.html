        <p>My name is Umeh Favour.I hail from Imo State. I live in Lagos,Nigeria with my family. I am a dark, short fine
            girl in her early
            teens. I love trying out new things, reading mafia
            romance novels and writing poems. I am a student of BYUPathway WorldWide currently studying Web
            Fundamentals. I'm excited about this course because I get to build my own webpage in my style and with my
            effort. I am the last child of 4 chiildren. I want to become a full stack developer in future and I hope to
            join tech communities and contribute my own
            quota of knowledge to the communities whether big or small. </p>
