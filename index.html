    <p>My name is Umeh Favour.I hail from Imo State. I live in Lagos,Nigeria with my family. I am a dark, short fine
        girl in her early
        teens. I love trying out new things, reading mafia
        romance novels and writing poems. I am a student of BYUPathway WorldWide currently studying Web
        Fundamentals. I'm excited about this course because I get to build my own webpage in my style and with my
        effort. I am the last child of 4 chiildren. I want to become a full stack developer in future and I hope to
        join tech communities and contribute my own
        quota of knowledge to the communities whether big or small. </p>
